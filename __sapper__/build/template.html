      living in Santa Cruz, California. I recieved my bachelor's in Audio
      Engineering and Technology in 2015 and began working with sound and
      making music. I started to develop an interest in writing code, so I
      learned HTML/CSS and JavaScript, and found myself creating web apps and
      eventually transitioning from audio engineering to full time web
      development. Since then, I have expanded my skills to include Go,
      Python, Vue, React and much more!" property=og:description> %sapper.base% <link href=manifest.json rel=manifest crossorigin=use-credentials> <link href=favicon.png rel=icon type=image/png> %sapper.scripts% %sapper.styles% %sapper.head% <title>Vincent Passanisi</title> </head> <body> <div id=sapper>%sapper.html%</div>
