      <div>
        Hi, I'm Vincent Passanisi and I am a full-stack developer currently
        living in Santa Cruz, California. I recieved my bachelor's in Audio
        Engineering and Technology in 2015 and began working with sound and
        making music. I started to develop an interest in writing code, so I
        learned HTML/CSS and JavaScript, and found myself creating web apps and
        eventually transitioning from audio engineering to full time web
        development. Since then, I have expanded my skills to include Go,
        Python, Vue, React and much more!
