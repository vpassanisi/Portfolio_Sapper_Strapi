      content="Hi, I'm Vincent Passanisi and I am a full-stack developer currently
      living in Santa Cruz, California. I recieved my bachelor's in Audio
      Engineering and Technology in 2015 and began working with sound and
      making music. I started to develop an interest in writing code, so I
      learned HTML/CSS and JavaScript, and found myself creating web apps and
      eventually transitioning from audio engineering to full time web
      development. Since then, I have expanded my skills to include Go,
      Python, Vue, React and much more!"
